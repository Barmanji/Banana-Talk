Welcome to Banana Talk
As you all have probably seen the Despicable Me! or Minions movie/cartoon/played game, this is just a little replica of how minions communicate.
Things I learned - Fetch/Response/catch error and in CSS Image Z-index to adjust it Z coordinates also a little bit about arrow functions.
challenges I faced - Indentation error because or arrow function, fetch/response code was hard to understand at first but then I got used to it.
