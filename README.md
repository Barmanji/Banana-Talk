Welcome to Banana talk
As you all have probably seen Despicable Me! or Minions movie/cartoon/played game etc , this is just a little replica of how minions communicate.
Things i leared - Fetch/Respone/catch error and in CSS Image Z-index to adjust it Z coordinates also a little bit about arrow functions.
challenges i faced - Identation error because or arrow function, fetch/response code was hard to understand at first but then i got use to it.
